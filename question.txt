You are given an HTML template that manages a list of songs, but it's not fully working yet!

The interface should allow the user to enter a song name which is then added to the list below upon clicking the Add Song button. 
Each song in the list has a Delete button, which should remove it from the list.

Most of the code is already written, but your task is to write the following 2 functions:

A deleteSong(song) function called by clicking the Delete button on any of the songs in the list.

An addSong() function called by clicking the Add Song button, which takes the value from the text input and adds this title 
to the list of songs cleaning the field at the end of the operation.

Note, that HTML and CSS is already implemented for you, and you only need to implement missing functions in main.js file.
